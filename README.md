# Fuzzy String Matching

Fuzzy String Matching will display the words that are very near to the word typed by the user using Levenshtein distance, hence it displays the correct and matching words.

It uses Levenshtein Distance to calculate the distance from the word typed by the user and the matching words from the dataset then return the word that is most relevant to the word with its weight.
